# Image-Hashing-android-app
Using the AMAC algorithm to create a hash value for any selected image by the user.
I did not upload the whole project file here as it was too big but in the zip file there is java code and also the application it self if anyone wants to test it out.
Maybe you're wondering what is AMAC and the answer is in this article --> https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~arce/files/Publications/3-AppImageAuth.pdf
